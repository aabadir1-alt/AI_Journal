This week I used AI while working on the Week 1 lab exercises to double-check my solutions and confirm that I was on the right track. I wrote my answers on my own first, and then asked ChatGPT to verify whether my reasoning and outputs matched the expected results.

Entry 2 (09/21/2025)
This week I used AI to check over my answers for the exercises and make sure I was on the right track. It was helpful for confirming whether my code was correct and matched what the assignment was asking for. I also ran into an error on Question 30, and I used AI to help me debug the issue and understand what I was doing wrong. This gave me a clearer explanation and helped me fix my code.

Entry 3 (09/28/2025)
This week, I used AI to support my work in the notebook. Specifically, I asked it to help me check whether my defined variables were correct and consistent with the assignment instructions. I also used AI to make sure my quick checks would run properly, so I could actually see results when testing my functions. This helped me catch small issues early and gave me more confidence that my code was functioning as intended.

Entry 4 (10/05/2025)
This week, I used AI to help me debug my code for Exercises #10 and #13 in the assignment. In both cases, my original solutions were logically correct, but the code wasn’t passing the automated checks because of small edge cases. AI helped me figure out why those issues were happening and how to adjust my code so it would pass the tests without changing the main logic. This process helped me better understand how small details in output formatting or rounding can affect whether code passes validation.

Entry 5 (10/12/2025)
This week I used AI as a support tool to help me check my answers and debug small issues in my code for the Week 5 exercises. I used it to confirm whether my logic for encapsulation, getters and setters, and property methods was correct, and to figure out why some of my demo outputs were not displaying as expected. I mainly used it to understand my mistakes and verify that my code was functioning the way it should.

Entry 6 (10/26/2025)
I used AI to confirm that the code I wrote for my Week 6 exercises was correct and followed the assignment requirements. It also helped me create demo sections to test and verify that each solution produced the expected results. This made it easier for me to check my work and understand how my code functions in practice.

Entry 7 (11/09/2025)
I used AI as a learning support tool to check my answers and help resolve errors in my code. It guided me through debugging issues and clarifying steps I wasn’t sure about, but I completed and understood the work myself.
Entry 7 (11/02/2025)
I used AI to help me fix two errors I was getting while working on my Week 7 Python assignment. One was a syntax error where I forgot to comment out an example line, and the other was a NameError because I tried to use a variable before creating it. AI helped me figure out what caused both issues and how to fix them. It made it easier for me to understand my mistakes and learn how to avoid them in the future.
